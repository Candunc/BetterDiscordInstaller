##Known Issues

* This outright doesn't work! Give me my <del>money</del> time back!
 * If the release haven't been updated, then try using the development build. This branch is generally stable enough, and will fix any issues that have occured since the last release.

* No progress window 
 * This is a limitation of the AppleScript, the progress window only works on OS X 10.10 or later. I did not include an alternate success message, as I didn't want duplicate popups on OS X 10.10. This _could_ be patched at a later time. :P

* Support for other operating systems
 * Believe it or not, AppleScript isn't compatible with Microsoft Windows. And, since there is no linux support for Discord, I didn't bother looking to see if this was possible.
